# Migration from Text Chunking to Ontology-Based Triple Extraction

## Current State Analysis

**Your chunker** (`chunking/run_chunker.py`) successfully processes text documents from various analytics/marketing domains (ATinternet, AgencyAnalytics, Databox, etc.) and creates paragraph-based chunks with metadata.

**Your inspiration materials** show:
1. **Ontology Development Framework**: A comprehensive plan for implementing OWL 2 ontologies with SPARQL endpoints (GraphDB/Fuseki) for e-commerce/analytics domain
2. **Knowledge Graph Pipeline**: A notebook demonstrating temporal agents working with knowledge graphs for triple extraction

**Your domain**: E-commerce analytics with structured data (users, orders, products, events, inventory) and unstructured marketing/analytics content.

## Phase 1: Triple Extraction Foundation (Week 1-2)

1. **Add NLP dependencies** for entity recognition and relation extraction
   - spaCy, transformers, or similar NLP libraries
   - Consider domain-specific models for e-commerce/analytics

2. **Implement Entity Extraction Pipeline**
   - Extend chunking pipeline to identify entities (products, KPIs, metrics, companies)
   - Extract relationships between entities from text chunks
   - Create structured triples (Subject-Predicate-Object)

3. **Design Core Ontology Schema**
   - Define base classes: `AnalyticsKPI`, `EcommerceMetric`, `Company`, `Product`, `Event`
   - Define properties: `measuredBy`, `belongsTo`, `hasValue`, `relatedTo`
   - Use existing schema.org vocabulary where possible

## Phase 2: Knowledge Graph Integration (Week 2-3)

4. **Set up Triple Store**
   - Install GraphDB Free or Apache Jena Fuseki (Docker)
   - Configure SPARQL endpoint for querying
   - Create initial RDF schema from ontology

5. **Triple Storage Pipeline**
   - Convert extracted triples to RDF format
   - Implement batch insertion to triple store
   - Add provenance tracking (source document, chunk ID)

## Phase 3: Semantic Query Layer (Week 3-4)

6. **SPARQL Query Interface**
   - Create query builders for common analytics patterns
   - Implement semantic search over knowledge graph
   - Add reasoning capabilities for inferred relationships

7. **Ontology-Enhanced RAG**
   - Integrate semantic queries with existing chunking
   - Use ontology to guide relevant context retrieval
   - Implement semantic similarity beyond text matching

## Phase 4: Validation & Enhancement (Week 4-5)

8. **Knowledge Graph Validation**
   - Verify triple consistency and completeness
   - Compare semantic queries vs traditional text search
   - Evaluate reasoning quality and performance

This plan aligns with your inspiration materials and leverages your existing chunking infrastructure while building toward sophisticated ontology-based semantic understanding.
