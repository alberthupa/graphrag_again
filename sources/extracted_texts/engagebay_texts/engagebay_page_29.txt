Source: MeasureSchool There are four goal types you can choose from. Here’s how they are different. Destination Goals: This is perfect for a thank you page or your checkout page. Each time a person visits your web page, the destination goal is triggered. It helps you track the number of visitors to each web page. Duration Goals: Here, this goal is triggered based on the amount of time a visitor spends on your website. This is a great option when you need to track your audience’s engagement levels. Pages/screens per session: This goal is triggered by the number of pages a visitor navigates before leaving your website. It gives you a sneak peek into your overall website engagement levels. Event: Event goals allow for more flexibility in terms of the actions that trigger the goal. With Google Tag Manager, you can create a goal if a threshold of scroll depth and a pre-defined duration is crossed. This is ideal for tracking your lead magnets, form conversions, or button clicks. Smart goal: Google uses machine learning techniques to allow some users to create smart goals. This is only open to accounts that have linked Google Analytics and Google Ads. Smart goals help you determine goal thresholds and apply them. 10.02.2025, 10:05 Master the Art of eCommerce Analytics with These 16 KPIs https://www.engagebay.com/blog/ecommerce-analytics/ 29/38
