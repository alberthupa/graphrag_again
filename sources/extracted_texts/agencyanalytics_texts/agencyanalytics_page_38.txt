To navigate the ocean of eCommerce, you need more than a compass; you need a fully-fledged GPS. That's where key performance indicators (KPIs) come into play. They provide the precise coordinates to help steer your client's eCommerce businesses toward success. One of the primary roles of KPIs is to turn the spotlight on new and repeat customers. By tracking metrics like the conversion rate and , you gain insights into how many visitors are transforming into customers and at what cost. On the other hand, the magic of the customer loyalty KPIs uncovers how many of these customers are returning for more. This is where the true treasure lies because a repeat customer spends more and requires less resource investment. A keen eye on the customer support team's performance is equally important. Timely and effective support creates happier customers and paves the way for increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, more repeat business. The average profit margin KPI provides insights into how much revenue your client retains after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This provides a snapshot of financial health, allowing you to steer the ship away from potentially choppy waters. Simply put, KPIs are your compass, map, and lighthouse all rolled into one. However, picking the right eCommerce KPIs that align with your client's business goals and strategies is critical. Because, at the end of the day, while all metrics provide data, not all data drives your client's business forward. Whether your client is a small online retailer or a large eCommerce business, with these KPIs at your disposal, you're well-equipped to guide them through any storm and help them find their treasure: sustained, profitable growth. cost per acquisition (CPA) Pricing Lo Skip to Content 10.02.2025, 10:05 Top 39 eCommerce KPIs That Drive Growth - AgencyAnalytics https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/ecommerce-kpis 38/44
