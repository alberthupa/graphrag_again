BROWSE BENCHMARK GROUPS (https://benchmarks.databox.com/groups) A couple of respondents also offered suggestions for how to improve your conversion rate. Alistair Dodds of Ever Increasing Circles (https://www.everincreasingcircles.com/) recommends “improving your conversion rate through onsite optimization split-testing, threshold-free shipping pricing, product bundles, and FOMO. With the same amount of traffic, you can effectively double or triple your revenue through effective conversion optimization testing (https://databox.com/conversion-rate-optimization-tests).” Kevin Williams of SurgeStream (https://www.surgestream.com/ecommerce-kpis-key-metrics-monitor/) offers a few more recommendations: 1. “If your website structure is confusing, reorganizing it so that users can find your products more easily can have a big impact on conversions.” 2. “Website speed: the slower your website, the lower your overall conversion rate.” 3. “Adding trust factors such as third-party site seals, logos, and customer reviews can also increase your conversion rate.” Cart Abandonment Rate The cart abandonment rate (https://databox.com/reducing-cart-abandonment) is a measure of the number of potential customers who start the checkout process but do not complete their purchase. ROCKETSHP’s (https://rocketshp.com/) Mark Hayes suggests looking for things like a complicated checkout process or too-high shipping costs when trying to fix a high abandonment rate. “Then I work with clients on fixing those. In one client’s case, fixing an overly complicated checkout process lead to $100,000 in additional revenue,” Hayes says. Eric Melillo of COFORGE (https://coforge.com/) echoes this approach. “Think of cart abandonment as a source of resistance. If there’s too much product info, the page may seem heavy. If there are too few features or weak photography, the product feels less valuable. If pages load slowly or there are too many checkout steps, users get impatient. Inflexible or problematic checkout processes cause the user to get frustrated and bail.” “Monitoring each friction point can help ease the checkout process. Typically, they are easy fixes that create quick wins, produce less abandonment, and generate more completed sales,” Melillo says. Here’s a dashboard template (https://databox.com/dashboard-examples/shopify) you can use to monitor cart abandonment rate and analyze eCommerce metrics and KPIs like monthly sales, average order value, new and returning customer sales, and more.
