Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) CAC is the cost associated with convincing a potential customer to buy a product or service. A low CAC is ideal for profitability. “Knowing and understanding CAC is critical. An eCommerce business selling high-ticket items for $1,000+ is okay with paying $100 to buy a customer, but if you’re selling items with a $50 price tag, you can’t afford that cost. For this reason, it’s essential to keep your CAC in check at all times,” says Djordje Milicevic of StableWP (https://stablewp.com/). “Think of it like this: you could make more sales by throwing more money into marketing. But if your CAC goes up, making more sales could actually bring down your profits. You’re bleeding money on acquiring new customers. If you don’t track your CAC, your business may soon collapse, and you won’t even know why.” “Understanding your CAC helps you plan how many customers you want to acquire in a certain period and then allocate your marketing budget appropriately to get the highest performance and profitability,” Milicevic concludes. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) CPA is similar to CAC but includes all costs associated with acquiring a new customer, not just marketing costs. A low CPA means you’re spending less to acquire each customer, which is good for your bottom line. According to Kyle Parsons of Ascenditt (https://www.ascenditt.com/), “CPA is the metric that calibrates for all other KPIs to tell us if they are performing at sustainable levels. If we know our CPA, then we can safely project our ROI, which is vital to scaling up.” Get practical strategies that drive consistent growth Read some (/newsletter) By submitting the completed form, you agree to our Terms of Service (/terms-of-service) and Privacy Policy (/privacy-policy). 5 10.02.2025, 10:05 24 Ecommerce KPIs for Tracking & Growing Sales https://databox.com/ecommerce-kpis 14/34
