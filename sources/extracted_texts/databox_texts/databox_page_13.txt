According to Kurt Estler of The Unofficial Shopify Podcast (https://unofficialshopifypodcast.com/): “No metric captures the overall health of an eCommerce business quite like customer lifetime value. Conversion rate, average order value, and return customer rate are all reflected in CLTV.” “Knowing how much revenue a customer generates over his/her lifetime can help you invest in the right channels sooner, even if your competitors shy away because the direct revenue from that channel appears to be unprofitable,” adds Troy Fawkes of Delta Growth (https://dg.agency/industry/ecommerce/). And in addition to tracking your CLTV, Andrew McLoughlin of Colibri Digital Marketing (https://colibridigitalmarketing.com/) also recommends tracking it “relative to the intake point to make sure that the business is growing steadily. Lifetime value should increase so that a new customer this year has a higher value than a new customer a year ago.” Revenue Per Visitor (RPV) RPV is a measure of the amount of money generated each time a customer visits your site. A high RPV indicates a high level of customer engagement.
