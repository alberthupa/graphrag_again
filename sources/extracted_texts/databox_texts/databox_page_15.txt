“For example, if your ecommerce store converts at 7%—but your CPA leaves no room for profit on the sale and lifetime value of the customer— then 7% is actually not a good sustainable number. CPA allows us to look at every other KPI with an honest vision and determine if we’re on the right track.” Average Profit Per Customer This KPI measures the average profit generated from each customer. The higher your average profit per customer, the more profitable your business. Stan Tan of Selby (https://www.selbys.net/)‘s sums it up as: “The more profit you can get out of a customer, the more you can afford to spend on acquiring that customer.” “For example, if each customer on average is worth $1,000 to you, you can afford to spend anything below $1,000 to be profitable. Whereas if a competitor’s average profit per customer is only $200, they can’t spend anything above $200—but you can because each customer is worth more.” Most Important eCommerce KPIs for Tracking Marketing Performance How impactful are your marketing efforts?
