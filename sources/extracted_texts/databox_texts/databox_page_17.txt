Revenue Per Site Visitor This metric is fairly self-explanatory, and Chloe Thomas of eCommerce MasterPlan (https://ecommercemasterplan.com/ian-hammersley- ecommerce-podcast/) recommends tracking it as it: “removes all of the bumps and enables you to quickly track performance across time.” Time On Site Jeff Neal of The Critter Depot (https://www.thecritterdepot.com/collections/dubia-roaches-for-sale) emphasizes the importance of tracking time on-site (https://databox.com/average-session-duration-benchmark), especially for businesses that focus on providing informative content to their customers. Neal says, “Ours is creating in-depth and informative care guides for reptile owners, so the metric we’re obsessively tracking is time on site for our care-guide pages.” “We believe if users are spending more time on the site and learning about reptiles as pets, then they are more likely to purchase live insects from our store.” Bounce Rate “Bounce rate (https://databox.com/what-is-a-good-bounce-rate) is an important e-commerce KPI,” says Louis Watton of Shiply (https://www.shiply.com/). “If lots of users are bouncing off of a page quickly, then you need to assess why that is. Are they not seeing the price they want? Not enough product images? No reviews or reasons to trust the site? The longer people stay on your site, the more familiar they get with your company, and the more likely you are to make a sale.” Get practical strategies that drive consistent growth Read some (/newsletter) By submitting the completed form, you agree to our Terms of Service (/terms-of-service) and Privacy Policy (/privacy-policy). 5 10.02.2025, 10:05 24 Ecommerce KPIs for Tracking & Growing Sales https://databox.com/ecommerce-kpis 17/34
