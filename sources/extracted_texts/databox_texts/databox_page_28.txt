Ecommerce platforms are also popular choices, offering built-in analytics that cater specifically to online retail metrics. Similarly, specialized analytics tools provide advanced capabilities, including user segmentation, funnel analysis, and heatmaps. With the shift to event-based tracking, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) has replaced Universal Analytics, offering a more comprehensive view of user interactions across devices and platforms.
